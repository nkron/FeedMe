<p>
    <span>FeedMe is a meal planning app designed to help those who want easy, basic plans filled with things they already know how to make.</span><br /><span> Other meal plan generators suggest such a wide variety of meals that it often feels like you have to become a chef on the side just to feed yourself.</span>
    <br />
    <span>FeedMe will have all of the functions of a standard meal planning/calorie counting app, but with the distinct feature of defining your go-to meals for easy planning. Sometimes you just want to be fed and continue on with your life.</span>
    <br /><br />
          <span>In its current state this is a complete meal planning app with the ability to search global databases for food, define your own foods, and track calories vs your own set goals.</span>
    <br />
    <span>Next steps are to expand the scope to include meals composed of individual foods, and integrating meal apis in addition to food apis. Then the meal generator will be able to be completed.</span>
